I'll explain why this is important, but first, we'll look at the modes as scales. A scale is just a series of notes defined by the interval (either a tone or a semitone) between each step. The modes of the major scale are simply, when taken in isolation, the seven notes of the major scale starting from each degree (i.e. note) of the scale. If we start with a C major scale, this means that every mode will have the same notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), but the interval breakdown of the scale will be different. So the first degree mode of C will be C-D-E-F-G-A-B, the second degree mode will be D-E-F-G-A-B-C and so on. Notice that the notes are the same, but the spacing of the intervals between them is different. This is because the intervals between C-D-E-F-G-A-B are tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone, but between D-E-F-G-A-B-C the intervals are tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone-tone."),a.a.createElement("p",null,"Hopefully you can see now how the notes of the modes of a given key don't change.

You'd be forgiven for wondering how playing all the same notes but starting from a different point is any different to playing 'non-modally'. But that's kind of the point - it's not. Knowing the modal scales is just the starting point for playing modally. What's more important is knowing which notes in the scale provide the 'colour', and knowing when to use them.
