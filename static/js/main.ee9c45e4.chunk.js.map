Ok, one scale, the trusty minor pentatonic. Maybe the blues scale. Natural minor if you want to get fancy.\n    Then one day you hear somebody talking about 'modes'. <i>Modes</i> you think. Sounds interesting. So you search <a\n          className=\"App-link\"\n          href=\"https://ecosia.org/search?q=modes\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          ecosia\n        </a> and three days later you're crying and aren't even sure what a guitar is any more.\n    Why? Because there's just so much information, claims and counter claims, fake news and scholarly arguments about what modes are and what they aren't. So I thought what the hell, one more explanation can't hurt, and here you are.\n  </p>\n)\n\nconst title = () => <div className='subtitle'>What is this page?</div>\n\nexport default Intro\n","import React from 'react'\nimport Panel from '../components/Panel'\n\nconst Modes101 = () => <Panel content={() => content()} title={() => title()} />\n\nconst content = () => (\n  <div className='modes-101'>\n    <p>\n      So what are modes? Well, Wikipedia defines a mode as <i className='quote'>a type of musical scale coupled with a set of characteristic melodic behaviors.</i>\n      That sounds easy enough, but it's the <i>second</i> part of that definition that often gets overlooked. I'll explain why this is important, but first, we'll look at the modes as scales.\n      A scale is just a series of notes defined by the interval (either a tone or a semitone) between each step.\n      The modes of the major scale are simply, when taken in isolation, the seven notes of the major scale starting from each degree (i.e. note) of the scale.\n      If we start with a C major scale, this means that every mode will have the same notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), but the interval breakdown of the scale will be different.\n      So the first degree mode of C will be C-D-E-F-G-A-B, the second degree mode will be D-E-F-G-A-B-C and so on.\n      Notice that the notes are the same, but the spacing of the intervals between them is different.\n      This is because the intervals between C-D-E-F-G-A-B are tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone, but between D-E-F-G-A-B-C the intervals are tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone-tone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Hopefully you can see now how the notes of the modes of a given key don't change.\n      If a progression is in the key of C, there are seven modal scales available to you, all featuring the same seven notes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This is a very easy place to get confused!\n      You'd be forgiven for wondering how playing all the same notes but starting from a different point is any different to playing 'non-modally'.\n      But that's kind of the point - it's not. Knowing the modal scales is just the starting point for playing modally.\n      What's more important is knowing which notes in the scale provide the 'colour', and knowing when to use them.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If you want more theory around how to analyse modes in general, check out Modes 102 below.\n      If you want to start looking into the individual modes themselves, pick a key below and let's have a look at the different modes in all their glory and how we can use them.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n)\n\nconst title = () => <div className='subtitle'>Modes 101</div>\n\nexport default Modes101\n","import React from 'react'\nimport Panel from '../components/Panel'\n\nconst Modes102 = () => <Panel content={() => content()} title={() => title()} />\n\nconst content = () => (\n  <div className='modes-102'>\n    <p>\n      Or is it modes 201..? Either way, once you're familiar with the basic concept of modes,\n      you can start to think about how to use them effectively. It's worth pointing out at this\n      stage that you'll often spot modal progressions within songs, but they may not apply to the\n      whole song. After all, keys change, you might want to throw dominant III chords in, accidentals occur.\n      So when looking for modal sections, try to look at short sections where you may spot modal themes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The next thing, and probably the single most important thing when thinking modally,\n      is that <em>context is everything</em>. We know that, given a key signature, all of the\n      modes of that major scale will consist of the same notes. That means you could play any\n      of the modal scales over any of the chords in the song, and it would be musically correct.\n      Would it be modal though?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Let's consider a V-IV-I progression in C. Let's say the chords are simply G-F-C.\n      If you skip ahead to the Mixolydian panel below, you'll see that V-IV-I works well\n      as a base for a Mixolydian scale. So you play a G Mixolydian pattern over that progression\n      and you think, well, this is just a C major scale really, isn't it? Well, hopefully this\n      is where the penny will start to drop. It's not enough to simply play the major scale but\n      start on a different note, you have to think about the modal context.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But what does it all <em>mean</em>, Basil? Well, there are certain notes in each modal scale\n      that give them all a unique sound and feel (and possibly taste). In the Mixolydian mode, the\n      really important notes are the major third and the minor seventh. The third is always important\n      as it determines if your scale is major or minor. In the Mixolydian, the minor seventh is what\n      distinguishes the scale from the major scale, and gives it that cool bluesy feel.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Ok, cool, so we're going to emphasise the third and seventh of our G Mixolydian scale - that's\n      a B and an F. But there are things we can do with the progression to really anchor down that\n      G Mixolydian feel. We could keep our V-IV-I, but make sure we use those notes in all of our chords,\n      which will mean we can really play on that B and F in our licks.
