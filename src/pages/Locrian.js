    Scary. Unpleasant. Tense. Threatening. There are minor and imperfect intervals all over the shop in this mode.
    There's a minor second, a minor third, a minor fifth, a minor sixth and a minor seventh.
    That's a lot of minor intervals. It's never going to sound 'nice'.

    This is really tough. It's apparently used a lot in metal but not being much of a metalhead,
    I can't really give you any examples. I could give you examples of songs with possible Locrian riffs,
    but nothing to really back up the fact that they're real Locrian progressions. The problem with this one
    is that the home chord of the mode is the m7â™­5 chord that's both a semitone away from the root of the key
    and also one bass note away from being the dominant V chord of the key. It's bloody hard to write anything
    that's truly Locrian - I did give it a shot in a rip off of the Jaws theme and that was enough for me.

    I mean... if you want. You can sort of use it similarly to the Phrygian scale.
    Just remember not to resolve it. If your solo isn't making you feel anxious, you aren't doing it right.

    <li>The 'Shark Theme' from Jaws evokes the Locrian mode (though as a two note theme it can't really be classified as modal at all)</li>
